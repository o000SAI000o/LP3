Perfect 👍 You uploaded your **LP-3 Mini Project Report** on **“Titanic ML Pipeline.”**
Below is a **complete list of the most probable viva questions** (the ones externals usually ask in Mini-Project reviews) — all answers are specific to your report and written in a clear, oral-friendly format for you to memorize easily.

---

## 🧠 SECTION 1 — BASIC INTRODUCTION

**Q1. What is your project about?**
It’s a machine learning pipeline that predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic shipwreck based on their demographic and socio-economic data like age, gender, ticket class, and family size. It automates preprocessing, model training, and prediction.

**Q2. Why did you choose the Titanic dataset?**
Because it’s a classic benchmark dataset for learning data preprocessing, feature engineering, and supervised classification. It’s publicly available on Kaggle and well-understood for evaluating different ML models.

**Q3. What is the goal of your project?**
To build an end-to-end ML pipeline that takes raw Titanic data, processes it, trains models like Logistic Regression and Random Forest, and predicts survival outcomes accurately.

**Q4. What type of learning problem is this?**
It’s a **binary classification problem** — the output (Survived) has two values: 0 = Not Survived, 1 = Survived.

---

## ⚙️ SECTION 2 — PROBLEM STATEMENT & OBJECTIVES

**Q5. State your problem statement.**
To predict the survival status of passengers aboard the Titanic using features like age, sex, class, and family relations, identifying the key factors influencing survival.

**Q6. What were your objectives?**

* Understand and clean the Titanic dataset.
* Handle missing data and encode categorical variables.
* Train Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest models.
* Evaluate performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
* Build a reusable Scikit-learn pipeline.

## 🧩 SECTION 3 — DATASET DETAILS

**Q7. What is the size of your dataset?**
It contains **891 records and 12 features**, including both numeric and categorical data.

**Q8. What are the input features and target variable?**
Features: Pclass, Sex, Age, SibSp, Parch, Fare, Embarked

* Converted categorical variables (*Sex*, *Embarked*) using OneHotEncoder.
* Normalized numerical columns (*Age*, *Fare*) with StandardScaler.

**Q10. What challenges did you face while preprocessing?**
Handling missing values and converting categorical columns without losing interpretability were the main challenges.

---

## 📊 SECTION 4 — EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA)

**Q11. What insights did you find from EDA?**

* Females had a much higher survival rate than males.
* Passengers in first class survived more often than those in third class.
* Younger passengers had higher survival chances.
* Traveling alone reduced survival probability.

**Q12. What visualization tools did you use?**
Matplotlib and Seaborn for plotting bar graphs, heatmaps, and correlation plots.

---

## 🔬 SECTION 5 — FEATURE ENGINEERING

**Q13. What new features did you create?**

* `FamilySize = SibSp + Parch + 1`
* `IsAlone = 1 if FamilySize == 1 else 0`
  These helped the model understand group survival behavior.

**Q14. Why is feature engineering important?**
It provides additional meaningful patterns to the model and improves prediction accuracy.

---

## 🧠 SECTION 6 — MODEL BUILDING

**Q15. Which algorithms did you use? Why?**

* **Logistic Regression:** For interpretability and baseline performance.
* **Decision Tree:** For visualizing decision rules.
* **Random Forest:** For higher accuracy and handling feature interactions.

**Q16. Which model performed best?**
The **Random Forest Classifier** performed best with around **82% accuracy**.

**Q17. What is a Random Forest?**
It’s an ensemble algorithm that builds multiple decision trees and combines their predictions (majority voting) to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.

**Q18. Why did Random Forest outperform Logistic Regression?**
Because Random Forest captures non-linear relationships and interactions between variables that logistic regression cannot.

---

## 🧰 SECTION 7 — MACHINE LEARNING PIPELINE

**Q19. What is a pipeline in Scikit-learn?**
A pipeline chains preprocessing and model training steps together so that data transformations and predictions happen sequentially in one object. It improves code modularity and reduces errors.

**Q20. What are the main components of your pipeline?**

* **ColumnTransformer:** Handles numeric and categorical preprocessing.
* **StandardScaler:** Normalizes numeric features.
* **OneHotEncoder:** Encodes categorical features.
* **RandomForestClassifier:** Learns survival predictions.

**Q21. What are the advantages of using a pipeline?**

* Cleaner, reusable code.
* Prevents data leakage.
* Easier model training and deployment.

---

## 📈 SECTION 8 — MODEL EVALUATION

**Q22. Which metrics did you use for evaluation?**
Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.

**Q23. Why use multiple metrics?**
Accuracy alone can be misleading. Precision and recall give more insight into false positives/negatives, and F1 balances both.

**Q24. What was your final accuracy?**
The Random Forest model achieved around **82% accuracy**.

**Q25. How can you improve this accuracy?**
By tuning hyperparameters (e.g., using GridSearchCV), adding new features, or using ensemble stacking.

---

## 🧪 SECTION 9 — IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

**Q26. Which tools and libraries did you use?**
Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.

**Q27. Why use Jupyter Notebook?**
Because it’s interactive and perfect for step-by-step data analysis, visualization, and testing.

**Q28. What are the main steps in your implementation?**

1. Load dataset
2. Handle missing values
3. Encode categorical data
4. Split dataset
5. Build pipeline
6. Train model
7. Evaluate performance
8. Test with sample input

## 💻 SECTION 10 — DEMONSTRATION

**Q29. Give an example of test input and output.**
Input: female, 25 years old, first class, fare ₹100, 1 parent/child
Output: *Predicted — Survived (1)*

**Q30. How do you verify correctness of prediction?**
By comparing predictions with actual labels in test data and evaluating metrics.

---

## 📉 SECTION 11 — EFFICIENCY & ANALYSIS

**Q31. What are your efficiency metrics?**
Accuracy (~82%), with balanced precision and recall showing the model generalizes well.

**Q32. Did you face overfitting?**
No major overfitting since Random Forest uses ensemble averaging and was evaluated with a test split.

---

## 🚀 SECTION 12 — CONCLUSION & FUTURE SCOPE

**Q33. What is your project’s conclusion?**
The pipeline effectively predicts Titanic survival and demonstrates how ML pipelines streamline preprocessing and modeling for real-world data.

**Q34. What improvements can be made?**

* Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV
* Using Deep Learning models
* Deploying as a Flask web app for real-time predictions
* Visual dashboards for insights

**Q35. What have you learned from this project?**
I learned end-to-end ML workflow — data cleaning, feature engineering, pipeline creation, and model evaluation — and how preprocessing choices affect accuracy.

## ⚡ SECTION 13 — GENERAL & TRICKY QUESTIONS

**Q36. Why fill missing ‘Age’ with median, not mean?**
Because Age has outliers; median is less affected by them.

**Q37. What is label encoding vs one-hot encoding?**
Label encoding assigns numeric labels; One-Hot encoding creates binary columns for each category. We used One-Hot to avoid introducing order among categories.

**Q38. What is the difference between precision and recall?**
Precision = True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives)
Recall = True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives)

**Q39. What is F1-score?**
It’s the harmonic mean of precision and recall; balances the two.

**Q40. Why split data into train and test sets?**
To test generalization ability — the model must perform well on unseen data.

**Q41. What is data leakage?**
When test data influences model training, leading to overly optimistic results. Pipelines help prevent it.

**Q42. What is cross-validation?**
A method to train and test the model on multiple data folds for robust performance estimation.

**Q43. How is Decision Tree different from Random Forest?**
A single Decision Tree can overfit; Random Forest averages many trees to reduce variance and improve accuracy.

**Q44. Why standardize numeric data?**
Because features with large ranges can dominate; scaling ensures fair model weight distribution.

**Q45. What does `handle_unknown='ignore'` do in OneHotEncoder?**
It avoids errors if unseen categories appear during prediction.
